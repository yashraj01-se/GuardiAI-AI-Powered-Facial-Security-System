# 🛡️ GuardiAI – Facial Security System

**AI-Powered Face Recognition for Secure Access**

GuardiAI is a deep learning–based facial authentication system designed to provide a smarter, faster, and more intuitive way to secure access. Instead of relying on traditional passwords or PINs, GuardiAI uses advanced computer vision and machine learning to identify authorized users — all in real time.

## 🚀 Features

* **Facial Recognition Authentication** – Unlock systems or trigger actions only for recognized faces.
* **Anchor & Positive Image Dataset Support** – Customizable training with user-specific images.
* **Negative Dataset Integration** – Robust model performance with diverse background data.
* **Real-Time Webcam Feed** – Continuous live video capture and authentication.
* **Optimized Image Preprocessing** – Cropping, resizing, and cleaning for consistent training input.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11+**
* **OpenCV** – Real-time video processing.
* **Pytorch** – Deep learning model creation and training.
* **NumPy & Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing.
* **UUID** – Unique image naming for dataset storage.
